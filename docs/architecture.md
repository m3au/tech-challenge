## Component Architecture

The test framework uses a layered architecture combining Page Object Models (POMs), Playwright fixtures, and BDD decorators for dependency injection and step definition mapping.

### Page Object Models

POMs encapsulate page interactions and define step definitions using decorators:

- **`CableConfiguratorPage`**: Main application interactions with cable selection, manufacturer filtering, and basket functionality
- **`CableSelectorPopup`**: Cable selector popup dialog interactions
- **`CookieBanner`**: Cookie banner dialog handling
- **`ProductDetailPage`**: Product detail page interactions

Each POM:

- Takes a `Page` instance in its constructor
- Uses decorators (`@Given`, `@When`, `@Then`) to define step implementations
- Registers itself with `@Fixture` decorator for dependency injection

### Fixture System

Fixtures provide dependency injection, connecting POMs to test context and environment configuration:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Playwright Test] -->|Extends| B[Base Fixtures]
    B -->|Adds| C[World Fixture]
    B -->|Adds| D[Page Fixtures]

    C -->|Provides| F[Page Instance]
    C -->|Calls| M[getEnvironment Function]
    M -->|Reads| N[process.env]
    M -->|Returns| E[Config Object]
    C -->|Provides| E

    D -->|Provides| G[CableConfiguratorPage]
    D -->|Provides| H[CableSelectorPopup]
    D -->|Provides| I[CookieBanner]
    D -->|Provides| J[ProductDetailPage]

    L[Playwright Config] -->|Populates| N[process.env]
    K[POMs] -->|Reads| N
```

**World Fixture**: Provides `world` object containing:

- `world.page`: Playwright page instance
- `world.data`: Processed environment configuration object (via `getEnvironment()` function)
- `world.testContext`: Test context object for tracking test steps and state (used for bug reporting)
- `world.testInfo`: Playwright TestInfo instance for test metadata and attachments

The fixture calls `getEnvironment()` which reads from `process.env` and returns a structured configuration object.

**Environment Variables**: All configuration is read from `.env` files loaded via `dotenv`:

- **Local development**: Uses `.env` (copied from `.env.example`)
- **CI/CD**: Uses `.env.production` with overrides from workflow env vars
- **Error handling**: All Playwright configs throw errors if `.env` is missing
- **No defaults**: All values must be provided in `.env` files (no hardcoded defaults in code)

**CI/CD Workflow Architecture**:

The project uses modular GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD:

- **`ci.yml`**: Main orchestrator workflow that coordinates test, lighthouse, and axe workflows
- **`unit-tests.yml`**: Unit tests workflow (runs before other workflows)
- **`test.yml`**: E2E tests workflow with sharding for parallel execution
- **`lighthouse.yml`**: Lighthouse performance audit workflow
- **`axe.yml`**: Axe accessibility audit workflow
- **`publish.yml`**: Report publishing workflow for GitHub Pages
- **`dependabot.yml`**: Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates (GitHub feature, not a workflow file)

Dependabot configuration is in `.github/dependabot.yml` (separate from workflow files). Dependabot is a GitHub feature that automatically creates pull requests for dependency updates. The configuration file specifies which package ecosystems to monitor and how to handle updates.

Workflows can run independently or be orchestrated together via the main CI workflow. Each workflow supports both `push/pull_request` triggers and `workflow_call` for reusability.

**Local Workflow Testing**:

GitHub Actions workflows can be tested locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) via Makefile targets:

- `make test` - Test E2E tests workflow locally (verbose output)
- `make lighthouse` - Test Lighthouse audit workflow locally
- `make axe` - Test Axe audit workflow locally
- `make publish` - Test publish reports workflow locally
- `make ci` - Test main CI workflow locally
- `make test-dryrun` - Dry run for workflow validation

See [Act Testing Documentation](./act-testing.md) for detailed setup and usage.

Variables from `process.env` are consumed by:

- Playwright config (test configuration like `TIMEOUT`, `WORKERS`, `BASE_URL`)
- Fixtures (via `getEnvironment()` function which processes `process.env` into structured config)
- POMs (for direct `BASE_URL` access)

**Note**: Audit test suites (`axe.spec.ts`, `lighthouse.spec.ts`) run as separate projects in the unified `playwright.config.ts`, but are not part of the core BDD test architecture.

**Page Fixtures**: Instantiates and injects POM instances into step definitions via dependency injection.

Playwright fixtures provide structured dependency injection:

- Separates concerns: POM instantiation separate from step logic
- Ensures test isolation: Each test gets fresh POM instances
- Centralizes environment configuration loading
- Provides type safety via TypeScript interfaces

### Component Interaction

1. **BDD generates test files** from Gherkin feature files
2. **Generated tests** import fixtures that extend Playwright's test
3. **Step definitions** receive POM instances via fixture parameters
4. **POM methods** (decorated with `@Given`/`@When`/`@Then`) implement step logic
5. **POMs interact** with Playwright's Page API to control the browser

## Step Definition Pattern

Step definitions use playwright-bdd decorators to map Gherkin steps directly to POM methods, eliminating the need for separate step definition files (`steps.ts`).

### Traditional Approach vs Decorator Approach

**Traditional BDD approach** requires separate step definition files:

```typescript
// steps.ts (traditional approach)
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber';
import { ConfiguratorPage } from '../poms/pages/configurator-page';

Given('I navigate to the configurator page', async function () {
  const page = new ConfiguratorPage(this.page);
  await page.navigate();
});
```

This creates **indirection**: Gherkin → step definition file → POM method, requiring manual wiring and maintaining synchronization between step text and implementation.

**Decorator approach** maps steps directly in POM classes:

```typescript
// configurator-page.ts (decorator approach)
import { getEnvironment } from '@data/config';

@Fixture('CableConfiguratorPage')
export class CableConfiguratorPage {
  constructor(protected page: Page) {}

  @Given('I navigate to the cable guy page')
  async navigate() {
    const { environment } = getEnvironment();
    await this.page.goto(`${environment.baseUrl}/intl/cableguy.html`);
  }
}
```

This **eliminates** the intermediate step definition layer, co-locating step text with implementation and reducing boilerplate.

### Decorator Mapping

- **`@Given`**: Setup steps ("Given I navigate to...")
- **`@When`**: Action steps ("When I click...")
- **`@Then`**: Assertion steps ("Then I should see...")
- **`@Fixture`**: Registers POM class for dependency injection
- **`@Step`**: Custom decorator for internal helper methods that should appear in Playwright test reports (defined in `tests/e2e/utils/decorators.ts`, re-exported from `@world`)

### Step Definition Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant G as Gherkin Step
    participant BDD as playwright-bdd
    participant F as Fixture
    participant POM as Page Object Model
    participant P as Playwright Page

    G->>BDD: "Given I navigate to..."
    BDD->>F: Resolve step definition
    F->>POM: Inject POM instance
    POM->>POM: Execute @Given method
    POM->>P: page.goto(...)
    P-->>POM: Page loaded
    POM-->>BDD: Step complete
```

### Implementation Example

```typescript
@Fixture('CableConfiguratorPage')
export class CableConfiguratorPage {
  constructor(protected page: Page) {}

  @Given('I navigate to the cable guy page')
  async navigate() {
    const { environment } = getEnvironment();
    await this.page.goto(`${environment.baseUrl}/intl/cableguy.html`);
  }
}
```

The `@Fixture` decorator registers the class, allowing step definitions to receive it as a parameter. The `@Given` decorator maps the Gherkin text to the method implementation.

**Rationale**: Traditional BDD frameworks require separate `steps.ts` files that manually wire Gherkin steps to POM methods, creating indirection and maintenance overhead. Using decorators directly on POM methods eliminates the intermediate layer, co-locates step text with implementation, and reduces sync issues between step definitions and implementations.
